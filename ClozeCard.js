// define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating cloze-deletion flashcards, e.g.: module.exports = ClozeCard;
// constructor should accept two arguments: text and cloze.
// constructed object should have a cloze property that contains only the cloze-deleted portion of the text.
// constructed object should have a partial property that contains only the partial text.
// constructed object should have a fullText property that contains only the full text.
// constructor should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does not appear in the input text.
// Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.
// bulk of this assignment is implementing ClozeCard. If you build a robust ClozeCard implementation, feel free to try your hand at implementing a front-end, as well.
